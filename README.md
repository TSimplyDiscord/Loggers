# TSimplyDiscord Loggers

This repository contains optional loggers for various logging libraries. Each logger contains a readme with instructions on how to use it with your [TSimplyDiscord](https://github.com/TSimplyDiscord/TSimplyDiscord/) project.

PRs to add new loggers are encouraged and appreciated.  We prefer that loggers are committed into this repository, however, we will allow links to other loggers as well.
